Popcorn API
===========

Popcorn Time API is developed to make it easier for anyone to create their own version of [Popcorn Time](http://popcorntime.sh). It contains:

 - Metadata about movies (taken from Trakt)
 - Metadata about TV Shows and individual episodes (taken from Trakt)
 - Multiple quality magnet links for every episode
 - Ability to easily filter content to the users' content


Installation
============
1. Install MongoDB
2. Install NodeJS (atleast Node v5.0.0 or greater)
3. install dependencies `cd popcorn-api` and `npm install`
4. Start the API with `npm start` or `node --harmony --harmony_destructuring --harmony_default_parameters --use_strict index.js`

Providers
=========

Content from kat.cr is grabbed with so called `providers` which can be configured in the `config.js` file. Providers will be converted to a search query for kat.cr so each provider can get a maximum of 10.000 torrents (or 400 pages). You can read more on how to make providers [here](https://github.com/team-pct/kat-api).

Routes
======

The API contains the following 'routes' which produce the example output:

`show/:imdb_id` - This returns all info and episodes for a particular show. Useful for the "show details" page in your app. The same can be done with movies by the following route: `movie/:imdb_id`

**Example**

`http://api-fetch.website/tv/show/tt1475582` returns the following:

```

These filters can be used separately or together.
