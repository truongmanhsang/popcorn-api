Popcorn API is developed to make it easier for anyone to create their own version of [Popcorn Time](http://popcorntime.sh). It contains:

- Metadata about movies (taken from Trakt).
- Metadata about TV shows and individual episodes (taken from Trakt).
- Metadata about anime shows (taken from Hummingbird).
- Multiple quality magnet links for every episode.
- Ability to easily filter content to the user's content.
- Add content manually through the CLI.

# Documentation

Documentation for the code can be generated with the command `npm run docs`. This will automatically generate the documentation which will be located in the `docs` directory. The `index.html` page will be the starting point. You can also view the documentation online right [here](https://popcorn-official.github.io/popcorn-api/manual/index.html). Or checkout the documentation for the API routes [here](http://docs.popcornofficial.apiary.io/).
